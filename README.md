Activity 1 Readme

1. Complete the implementation of the provided Card class. You will be required to complete:
a. a constructor that takes two String parameters that represent the card’s rank and suit, and an int
parameter that represents the point value of the card;
b. accessor methods for the card’s rank, suit, and point value;
c. a method to test equality between two card objects; and
d. the toString method to create a String that contains the rank, suit, and point value of the card
object. The string should be in the following format:
rank of suit (point value = pointValue)
2. Once you have completed the Card class, find the CardTester.java file in the Activity1 Starter
Code folder. Create three Card objects and test each method for each Card object.
